make pull request:
 I implement my changes, commit them with meaningful messages, and push the branch to the remote repository. Then I go to GitHub (or GitLab), select my branch, and click on ‘Compare & pull request’. I fill in the title and description clearly explaining the changes, link it to any related issues or JIRA tickets, request a code review, and submit it.
 I you want to impress sir:
 “Before raising the PR, I make sure to pull the latest main and rebase or merge if needed to avoid conflicts. I also check formatting, run tests, and include screenshots if it’s a UI change.

 key point :->   Before start git pull and rebase -> push code ->Go github -> select my branch -> Compare & pull request -> fill title & descr -> link that to related JIRA ticket
